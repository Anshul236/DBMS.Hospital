The Hospital Management System is a web-based application developed to simplify and organize the daily operations of a hospital. It offers features for managing patient information, doctor schedules. By digitizing thesefunctions, the system aims to improve the accuracy, speed, and overall efficiency of hospital workflows. This system replaces traditional manual methods of record-keeping, which are often time-consuming and error-prone. It provides a centralized platform where data is stored securely and can be easily accessed or updated by authorized users. Different user roles such as administrators, doctors, and receptionists are supported, each having access to specific features based on their role. The main goal of this project is to enhance hospital management by reducing paperwork,
improving patient care, and ensuring smooth coordination between departments. With the help of technologies like PHP, SQL, and CSS
